# Causal Inference Project

The repository contains the final project carried out for the course on "Causal Inference: Theory and Applications" at Collegio Carlo Alberto (Turin). <dr>
The project compares the linear Difference in Differences developed by Card and Krueger (1994) and the Double Machine Learning Difference in Differences by Chernozhukov et al. (2018). <dr>
The comparison is conducted using both synthetic and empirical data across various settings, including those where the traditional assumptions underlying linear Difference-in-Differences (DiD) are not satisfied.
